# National Energy Levels and Usage

Our project focuses on illustrating the usage of energy across major US cities, as well as the overall national import and export of energy sources.

## Part I - Statewide Energy Use

The first part focuses on the usage of energy across the United States. Our map will indicate the amount of energy consumed by type within each of the states. The darker the color, the more energy is consumed.

## Part II - Import and Export

Using a bar graph, we plan on representing the different levels of import and export for all of the pre-specific energy types. Users can scroll over a sidebar to highlight specific energy types.
