# National Energy Levels and Usage

Our project focuses on illustrating the usage of energy across major US cities, as well as the overall national import and export of energy sources.

## Part I - Major US Cities

The first part focuses on the usage across US cities. We will have a map of the United States with major cities outlined in a circle. These circles' size depends on the level of usage, and colors on the type of energy. Scrolling over a side key allows users to see the specific form of energy on the map.

## Part II - Import and Export

Using a bar graph, we plan on representing the different levels of import and export for all of the pre-specific energy types. Users can scroll over a sidebar to highlight specific energy types.
